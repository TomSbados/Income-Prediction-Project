# Income-Prediction-Project
This project aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on various demographic and employment-related features. Using "adult" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The focus of this project was to learn the following skills:
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
   
2. Data Visualization
   
3. Feature Engineering
   
4. Model Training and Evaluation
   
5. Hyperparameter Tuning

The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 86.5% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting income based on the given features. The most important features identified include educational level, capital gain, age, and marital status.
